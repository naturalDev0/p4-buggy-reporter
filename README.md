# [Buggy-Reporter](https://buggyreporter-tl.herokuapp.com/)

TGC project #4 - A bug tracker portal for users to report and creating a community where professionals can intervened the problems. The platform will allow users to login and make donations to the portal as well.

## UI/UX

## Testing



<hr/>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

*[Please take note that your project environment will be different ...]*

* The website is currently hosted on Heroku, developed on AWS Cloud 9 IDE platform and the source code is stored on Github Repository. Occasionally, I would perform some lightweight code edits using Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) Code (e.g. README.md).

### Steps deployment

1. Create a new repository for your project on your local computer.
    ```
    git init .                  // initialize repo with all files
    git add .                   // add all files into local staging
    git status                  // check if any files are left out before commiting
    git commit -m "message"     // commit change with message of your files into repo
    ```
2. Add your remote git link for uploading your files onto Github later on.
    ```
    // add your remote repo link
    git remote add origin https://github.com/naturalDev0/p4-buggy-reporter.git
    ```
3. Push your files onto your remote
    ```
    // upload your files into your remote repo
    git push -u origin master
    ```

4. Should you have the interest to work the files offline, you can do so by cloning a copy.
    ```
    // Clone the selected repo offline
    git clone https://github.com/naturalDev0/p4-buggy-reporter.git
    ```

    NOTE: All commits are pushed to master branch, as currently there is no intention of creating new branches.

### Additional packages to install

1. 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
